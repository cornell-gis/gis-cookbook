# Extract raster from FileGDB

FileGDB is a proprietary file format that has limited functionality outside of Esri software.  QGIS and other open-source software may be able to read vector layers thanks to GDAL's [OpenFileGDB driver](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/openfilegdb.html), but cannot read raster layers.

The following video demonstrates how to use ArcMap to extract rasters from a FileGDB and save them to a GeoTIFF file that can be used in QGIS and other software.
