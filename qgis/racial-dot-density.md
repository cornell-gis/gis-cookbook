# Racial dot density map

There are many ways of showing demographic data on a map.  A racial dot density map uses different colors of dots to represent the relative numbers of people of different races within an area.

This map style was inspired by the [Racial Dot Map](https://demographics.coopercenter.org/racial-dot-map) created by Dustin Cable at the University of Virginia.

The following video shows how to download US Census data from [censusreporter.org](https://censusreporter.org/) and use QGIS to create a racial dot map, where each dot represents one or more people, color-coded by race.  To do this, we create a QGIS polygon style that uses multiple "random marker fill" symbol layers.
